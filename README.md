# Xception model for tomato sorting

it's a model devlopped fully on python, using Tensorflow library

### Installation

install anaconda throught [this link](https://Anaconda.com/downloads//) then jupiter notebook to open it or using google [Collabs](https://colab.research.google.com) online

> define the directory wheter online as we did or offline on local server

### Online

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

### Offline

only importing the Os will be enought

### Usage

1. Python

   by import Sorting foods by how fresh they are is another way to make sure they are safe.
   Tomatoes that are too ripe or have gone bad can have bacteria that can make you sick if you eat them.
   By putting tomatoes in the right category based on how fresh they are,
   companies can find and remove potentially harmful food from the supply chain
2. How to use?

it can be used inside the notebbok by testing the image pathway to get prediction like this:
img = Image.open("/content/drive/MyDrive/final_tomato_except2/data/user_feed/fresh02.jpg")
Prediction(img)

also reday to be used in a mobile application or an embedded system by saving its weight

### Contributing

this model can help cut down on the cost of manual inspections, which take time and require skilled workers.
